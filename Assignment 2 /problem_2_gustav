\textit{Problem 2. Please briefly describe the three empirical tests of the borrowing constraints
theory proposed by Zeldes (1989). In particular, make sure you mention: i) why he splits
the observations into two groups, ii) in which case and why each test supports the borrowing
constraints theory or the PIH.} \\

Zeldes (1989) tests the null hypothesis that households smooth consumption over their life cycle as predicted by the PIH against the alternative that agents are maximizing lifetime utility subject to a set of borrowing constraints. In contrast to other papers, he does not test the PIH against, either the alternative that the model does not fit the data or that consumers behave "Keynesian" (i.e. consumption equals a share of income). \
All tests are based on the Euler equation, derived from the maximization of expected lifetime utility. The equation implies that the marginal utility from consuming one unit today should be equal to the discounted expected marginal utility from what the agent would have received if the unit was invested and consumed in the future period.  \
The first test is based on a regression of the growth of food consumption on a set of control variables and income. Zeldes (1989) splits the sample into two groups.
The sample restriction is based on whether the borrowing constraint is likely to be binding (Group 1) or not (Group 2). If a household at any given time period belongs to group 1, the Lagrangian multiplier on the constraint is necessarily positive. Relaxing the constraint would therefore increase expected lifetime utility. Likewise if a household belongs to group 2 current income should not have a positive effect on consumption growth. The split is based on the liquid financial assets to income ratio. 
Zeldes (1989) uses a sample split because it is not possible to derive a closed-from expression of the Lagrangian multiplier. \\
The first test shows that for group 1, income reduces the growth of consumption statistically significantly, as predicted by the borrowing constraints theory. For group 2 income does not affect consumption growth significantly. The prediction of the Euler equation is thus violated for the borrowing constrained group 1, whilst in line for group 2. 
The second test is based on the one-sided inequality of the Euler equation. The Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda_{it}$ must be strictly positive. This is because households are borrowing, but not saving constraint. Zeldes (1989) tests the size and direction of the average Lagrangian multiplier for group 1 by constructing an estimate for the population level Lagrangian multiplier from group 2. He finds that there is a positive and statistically significant effect only at the $10\%$ level. Thus the borrowing constraint theory is somewhat supported in this case but the evidence is not strong. 
The third test is based on whether the Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda_{it}$ is negatively related to current real disposable income $y_{it}$. The premise is that higher current income should lead to diminished utility from easing the borrowing constraints. Zeldes $(1989)$ uses the consistent estimate of group 1's average excess growth in consumption due to liquidity constraints, $\hat{x}_{it+1}$. He finds a negative, albeit not statistically significant relationship between income and excess consumption. However this regression estimates a total derivative. Thus the results of the third test are theoretically and empirically not clear cut, since Zeldes cannot identify the partial derivative, with a ceteris paribus interpretation. Should increases in income signal an even higher anticipated future income stream as well, excess consumption growth might not be affected.
